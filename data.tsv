Yeliang Shou	Hello friends it's me. I'm in 4A se and am basically a dinosaur but feel like a child. The past two internships I had are at Roblox and Ubisoft, but I AM NOT A GAME DEV* disclaimer.

Nim Wijetunga	Hey I'm Nim a 4A SE student! Over my 4 (going on 5) years at Waterloo i've had the amazing opportunity to work in several different areas of software (ranging from web dev to ML to Distributed Systems). While co-op has been a highlight of my experience at Waterloo, I think that after 5 years what i'll take away is all of the stuff i've done outside of academics, ranging from various design teams, to intramural's and even dragon boating! I'd love to share my experiences and things that I wished I knew when I was in your position so that one day you can do the same for others!	Hey I'm Nim a 4A SE student!
