    <h2> About </h2>
    <div>
      SE Coffee Chats is an initiative to help new SE students meet upper year students. The goal is to help you
      get to know upper years better, learn something new, and make a new
      friend!
      <br />
      <br />
      To make sure you get the most value out of your chat, you tell us who you
      want to grab coffee with, and we'll match you based on bandwidth and first
      come first serve. Once you get matched, you'll submit a form to Shaz, pick
      up a $10 Balzac's gift card, and have your chat!
      <br />
      <br />
      Link to form coming soon!
